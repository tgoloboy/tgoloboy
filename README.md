## Hi there 👋

<!--
**tgoloboy/tgoloboy** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I'm the founder and director of Compatriot Academy, an online non-profit education platform that teaches the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU), a theory of everything that describes the CTMU as a self-simulation occuring in a universal mind. I'm also a co-developer of DreamComposer, an AI-powered software to create beautiful, cinematic animations to express metaphysical ideas using a universal visual language called DreamTalk. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning just about everything: metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, business, self-development, logic, algebra, analysis, computation, classical physics, quantum physics, relativity, perception, decision-making,neuroscience, decision theory, game theory, utility maximization, classical works, philosophical analysis, biblical studies, comparative theology, mysticism, governance, civilization, political theory, Ancient Greek, Hebrew... but inclusive of them all is the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe!!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible through enlightening our planetary civilization through universal truth. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with content production and platform development for Compatriot Academy and my CTMU YouTube channels with 100k+ combined subscribers.
- 💬 Ask me about the CTMU. 
- 📫 How to reach me: tgoloboy@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was in the 2016 AAU Junior Olympics Games for Cup Stacking!
