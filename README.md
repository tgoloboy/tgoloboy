## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**tgoloboy/tgoloboy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm the founder and director of Compatriot Academy, an online non-profit education platform that teaches the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU), a theory of everything that describes the CTMU as a self-simulation occuring in a universal mind. I'm also a co-developer of DreamComposer, an AI-powered software to create beautiful, cinematic animations to express metaphysical ideas using a universal visual language called DreamTalk. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning just about everything: metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, business, self-development, logic, algebra, analysis, computation, classical physics, quantum physics, relativity, perception, decision-making,neuroscience, decision theory, game theory, utility maximization, classical works, philosophical analysis, biblical studies, comparative theology, mysticism, governance, civilization, political theory, Ancient Greek, Hebrew... but inclusive of them all is the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe!!
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creating the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible through enlightening our planetary civilization through universal truth. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with content production and platform development for Compatriot Academy and my CTMU YouTube channels with 100k+ combined subscribers.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the CTMU.
